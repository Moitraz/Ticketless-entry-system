# Ticketless-entry-system

Used Python, SQLite, Tkinter, CustomTkinter to create a ticketless entry system,
which would take credentials from the user and generate a QR code and send it to
the email of the user as well as show the route from the source to the destination,
when the QR is scanned, it generates the ticket.
